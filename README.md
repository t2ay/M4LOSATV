# M4 LOSATV
This mod converts the USA's M2 Bradley into a fictional variant called the M4 LOSATV (Line of Sight Anti-Tank Vehicle).

Much thanks and full credit given to Cyance (https://github.com/Cyances) who allowed me to use the code from their M6A2 ADATS mod.

## Features
- Renames the M2 Bradley to M4 LOSATV
- Converts the BGM-71C I-TOW on the M2 to the MGM-166 KEM (Kinetic Energy Missile)
- Increases missile capacity on the M2 to 4+12 (from 2+8). Reload time is not affected.

Except for the changes to the missiles, the M4 LOSATV is otherwise a completely typical M2 Bradley, with the same 25mm autocannon, 7.62x51mm coaxial machine gun, fire control system, armor, and mobility. No configuration is needed for this mod.

## The M6M-166 KEM
The MGM-166 KEM (Kinetic Energy Missile) is massively different from other anti-tank guided missiles in that it relies on a long rod penetrator to defeat enemy armor instead of a shaped charge. With a penetrator adopted from a 140mm tank gun, capable of defeating up to 780mm of rolled homogenous armor, the KEM will punch through nearly all Soviet armor arrays of the time with catastrophic post-penetration damage.

Kinetic energy missiles are also _much_ faster than typical ATGMs, with a maximum velocity of 1,500 meters/second. In game, the MGM-166 leaves the launcher at maximum velocity, and does not decelerate; this is subject to change in future updates. Such incredible speed makes you far less vulnerable to counterfire, and decreases time-to-impact to under 6 seconds at maximum range.

#### YOU NEED STABLE, DECENT FPS TO FOR THE MISSILE TO GUIDE PROPERLY! LOW OR UNSTABLE FPS MAY RESULT IN THE MISSILE JUMPING OFF COURSE OR SLAMMING INTO THE GROUND!
